## What it looks like

when you visit a bandcamp page with a listenable album, a notification will appear to download the album :

![A wild notification appeared!](https://jaymoulin.github.io/bandcamp-down-chrome-ext/notif-1.png "A wild notification appeared!")

Just click on it to download the album

![Download in progress](https://jaymoulin.github.io/bandcamp-down-chrome-ext/notif-2.png "Download in progress")

![Zip downloaded](https://jaymoulin.github.io/bandcamp-down-chrome-ext/zip.png "Zip downloaded")

![All files in a great folder hierarchy](https://jaymoulin.github.io/bandcamp-down-chrome-ext/folder.png "All files in a great folder hierarchy")

## Update 0.3.0

You can now configure the extension with the notification you want to see.

Also, a new download page allows you to download multiple albums at the same time and retry tracks that failed to download.
This page offers you really cool options to ease album downloading !
